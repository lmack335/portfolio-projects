# VSCO Girl Game

In VSCO_Game, you play as a teenage "VSCO girl" who loves to take selfies with all her trendy 90s themed stuff.  You must search through your bedroom to collect all of the required goodies so that your next selfie earns plenty of likes on social media!

This game was developed for use as part of a social-emotional learning activity for at-risk middle school girls.  A group of 5-6 girls were given time to play through the game, then they participated in a discussion circle asking about their reaction to the game; the impact and effects of social media stereotypes like "VSCO girls" on women, social expectations, self-esteem, consumerism; and the use (and mis-use) of social media platforms in their own lives (peer pressure, social expectations, bullying, etc).
